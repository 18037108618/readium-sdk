Building for Android
--------------------------------------

This library is all set up to compile as a shared library for Android. At 
present it targets android-9 and uses gcc v4.7. There is no real JNI layer at 
present, and it has only been built on OS X. I assume that a working NDK on any 
platform will have success, though.

Please refer to the file HACKING at the root of the project for low-level 
details you'll need to write portable code in this project.


Prerequisites
--------------------------------------

- Android NDK release 8e
- A lot of patience


Compilation
--------------------------------------

1. From a Terminal, go into the Platform/Android subdirectory of the 
   readium-sdk repository (this directory).
2. Run `ndk-build.sh build <path-to-ndk>` to build. My invocation looks like 
   this, for example:

~> sh ndk-build.sh build /Applications/Android-Dev-Tools/ndk

Everything else should be set up appropriately by that script.
